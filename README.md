# Executive Summary
Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are defined by the Children's Bureau as "traumatic events occurring before the age of 18". They can be categorized as abuse, household challenges and neglect.  

## Problem Statement
Can Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) be used to predict future behavior and outcomes?
   - How well can it be used to predict whether someone's use of smokeless tobacco products?
   - How well can it be used to predict whether someone's activity limitation due to health problems?
   - How well can it be used to predict whether someone is in good or poor health?
   - How well can it be used to predict someoneâ€™s smoker status?
   - Can factors other than ACE influence the precision of the models?
