## Eboni Lee, DSIR-824

# Executive Summary
Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are defined by the Children's Bureau as "traumatic events occurring before the age of 18". They can be categorized into abuse, household challenges and neglect. Their importance lies in the fact that they have been linked to a decreased lifespan, mental illness, decreased opportunities, chronic diseases, etc. Essentially, they can affect every aspect of someone's adult life negatively. It is noteworthy to say that they are preventable, when resources are allocated appropriately.

## Problem Statement
Can Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) be used to predict future behavior and outcomes?
   - How well can it be used to predict whether someone's use of smokeless tobacco products?
   - How well can it be used to predict whether someone's activity limitation due to health problems?
   - How well can it be used to predict whether someone is in good or poor health?
   - How well can it be used to predict someoneâ€™s smoker status?
   - Can factors other than ACE influence the precision of the models?

## Data 
- The data was collected from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), where the ACE module was included, for the years between 2009 - 2012. 
    - It can be downloaded [here](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/about/archived.htm)
- The amount of features within the datasets range from 359 - 454: 
    - After cleaning, analysis and modeling was only performed on the 31 features, including ACEs, below
